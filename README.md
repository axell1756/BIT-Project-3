# BIT-Project-3
3rd BIT Project SQL+

<h3>Hello and welcome to Dream Team's GITHUB page, where all the magic happens!</h3>
<hr>
<br>
<p>So, main task right now is to design a SQL+ database layout (data, asociation etc...).</p>
<p>Afterwards, we shall start implementing this to real world database.</p>
<p>When this is done, PYthon comes in. Access by SQLAlchemy module in Python (I assume this module has to be downloaded and installed manualy)</p>
<hr>
Good luck!
