# BIT-Project-3
3rd BIT Project SQL+

Hello and welcome to Dream Team's GITHUB page, where all the magic happens!

So, main task right now is to design a SQL+ database layout (data, asociation etc...).
Afterwards, we shall start implementing this to real world database.
When this is done, PYthon comes in. Access by SQLAlchemy module in Python (I assume this module has to be downloaded and installed manualy)

Good luck! 

P.S.: If any questions, e-mail me on gniteckis@gmail.com
